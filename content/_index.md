## Optimized for impact

Fetch makes it incredibly easy to create and customize beautiful lists of adoptable animals that your visitors will love.

- **It's built for mobile.** More than half of all web traffic in the US comes from mobile devices. Make sure visitors can browse your adoptable animals on whatever device they have with them.
- **It makes finding the perfect companion easier.** An automatically generated set of filters lets your visitors easily find the perfect match.
- **It adapts to your design.** Fetch inherits the colors, fonts, and branding from your site. Settings and CSS hooks make it easy to customize.

## How does it work?

Just add two files and a little text to your site. Fetch uses the Petfinder API to handle the rest. If your site runs on WordPress, it also includes a plugin to make it even easier.

No ugly iframes or scroller widgets. No expensive developers. Just a beautiful, mobile-friendly list of your pets. [Check out the demos](/demos) to learn more.

***Note:*** *You will need to [sign up for a free API key from Petfinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).*

## What content management systems does Fetch work with?

If your website allows you to upload CSS and JavaScript files, Fetch should work with it. This includes:

- WordPress (Fetch comes with a plugin to make it even easier)
- NationBuilder
- Weebly
- Squarespace
- And more!

## Browser Compatibility

Fetch works in all modern browsers, including MS Edge. It does not work in Internet Explorer. Unsupported browsers can be shown a link to your pets on Petfinder.com.
